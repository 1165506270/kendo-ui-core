      :description: The layout type
      :values:
          - tree - organizes a diagram in a hierarchical way and is typically used in organizational representations.
          - force - The force-directed layout algorithm (also known as the spring-embedder algorithm) is based on a physical simulation of forces acting on the nodes whereby the links define whether two nodes act upon each other. Each link effectively is like a spring embedded in the diagram. The simulation attempts to find a minimum energy state in such a way that the springs are in their base-state and thus do not pull or push any (linked) node.
          - layered - Layered graph layout is a type of graph layout in which the nodes of a (directed) graph are drawn in horizontal or vertical layers with the links directed in the complementary direction. It is also known as Sugiyama or hierarchical graph layout. When the graph is a tree the layout reduces to a standard tree layout and thus can be considered as an extension to the classic tree layout.
