    <p>Kendo UI Mobile provides automatic platform dependent styling of form elements when they are added to a mobile View. Currently the following form elements are supported and styled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>inputs of types <b>text</b>, <b>password</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>url</b>, <b>email</b>, <b>number</b>, <b>tel</b>, <b>file</b>(not in iOS), <b>date</b>, <b>time</b> <b>month</b> and <b>datetime</b></li>
        <li>single <b>select</b> elements or Kendo DropDownList replacements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        While styled, the input elements that require a picker, use the native one provided on the current platform if it is supported.
        Overall HTML5 form elements support is limited to mobile OSes that support them, e.g. iOS 5.x+, Android 4.x+, BlackBerry 6.x+, BlackBerry Playbook 1.x+,
        though they will continue to be styled on older platforms, leaving you the choice of an external picker where needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select elements are also automatically styled for each platform and will use the natively provided select dialog or popup on each platform. However, due to numerous browser
        bugs in their implementation (mainly in Android), we also styled the Kendo UI DropDownlist to look like the native picker and we recommend that you use it instead as a select replacement.
        If you do, you will need to add <b>kendo.dropdownlist.js</b> and its requirements <b>kendo.list.js</b> and <b>kendo.popup.js</b> in your project.
    </p>
    <p>Known browser issues you may encounter, with possible workarounds:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select element drop down arrow can't be removed in Firefox.</li>
        <li>Select element touch target in Android 2.x remains in the same place when a transformation is applied on a parent and also select element text can't align right in WebKit, which is needed for iOS styling.
            You can work around these by using a Kendo DropDownList. It receives platform specific styling when initialized in a Kendo UI Mobile application.</li>
        <li>Input with type search shows reset icon in desktop WebKit, which is not present on a mobile device.</li>
        <li>All input and select elements in Android 4.x default browser render a fake input when focused.
            This focused input can't be styled and is not part of the page flow so it won't scroll and you may end up with 2 identical but differently styled input elements at some point.
            Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any workaround for this issue, unless you keep your forms short - without scrolling.</li>
    </ul>
