    <p>Kendo UI Mobile provides automatic platform dependent styling of form elements when they are added to a mobile View. Currently the following form elements are supported and styled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inputs of types <b>text</b>, <b>password</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>url</b>, <b>email</b>, <b>number</b>, <b>tel</b>, <b>file</b>(not in iOS), <b>date</b>, <b>time</b> <b>month</b> and <b>datetime</b>;</li>
        <li>Single <b>select</b> elements or Kendo DropDownList replacements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The input elements with a picker use the native one from the current platform if it is supported.
        HTML5 form elements are fully functional only on the following platforms: iOS 5.x+, Android 4.x+, BlackBerry 6.x+, BlackBerry Playbook 1.x+.
        The styling will still work on older platforms, but the functionality will be limited to text input only.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Select elements are also automatically styled for each platform and will use the native select dialog or popup. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Known browser issues and possible workarounds:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Select element touch target in Android 2.x remains in the same place when a transformation is applied on a parent. 
            Select element text can't be right-aligned in WebKit, which is needed for iOS styling.
            A work around for both is to use the Kendo DropDownList widget. 
            It receives platform specific styling when initialized in a Kendo UI Mobile application.
            
            To do so, include <b>kendo.dropdownlist.js</b> and its requirements 
            <b>kendo.list.js</b> and <b>kendo.popup.js</b> in the application.
            </li>
        
        <li>Input with type search shows reset icon in Chrome and Safari, which is not present on a mobile device.</li>
        
        <li>All input and select elements in Android 4.x default browser render a fake input when focused.
            This focused input can't be styled and is not part of the page flow so it won't scroll 
            resulting in 2 identical but differently styled input elements at some point.
            
            There is no workaround for this issue, unless the form fits the screen and no scrolling is needed.</li>
            
        <li>Select element drop down arrow can't be removed in Firefox.</li>
    </ul>
