# Progress<sup>®</sup> Kendo UI Wrappers for React

The Kendo UI wrappers for React are part of the Kendo UI suite for jQuery.

They provide an easy way to use and configure Kendo UI widgets in your React application. This means that although you are using React directives or components to set up the UI component, the functionality comes from the jQuery Kendo UI widgets.

For more information, refer to the [official documentation on Kendo UI Wrappers for React][http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui-wrappers-react/introduction](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui-wrappers-react/introduction).
